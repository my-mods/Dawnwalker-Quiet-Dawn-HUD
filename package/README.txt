# Quiet Dawn - Configurable HUD

A quiet view of the world, with health and stamina returning when needed.

For **The Blood of Dawnwalker**. Combat, drawing a weapon, lock-on, and focus no longer reveal the general HUD.

- **Enemy health:** health bars and their end caps stay hidden for ordinary enemies and bosses, including boss health-phase indicators. Enemy names and difficulty icons are hidden by default, with separate settings in the optional menu or `settings.ini`. Enemy stamina, wounds and combat warnings retain game behavior.
- **Enemy lock-on marker:** Four independent Combat cues toggles control counterattack directions, unblockable warnings, directional parry cues and the lock icon. All default to Off. The center dot is always hidden; directions hide the center lock icon.
- **Player health and stamina:** at their default 0% setting, shown together at full opacity after damage, meaningful healing or stamina use, while health is strictly below **50%**, or while stamina is strictly below **20%**. Vampire health follows the blood bar; human health follows HP.
- **Hide delay:** **4 seconds** after the last health/blood alert; **1.5 seconds** after the last stamina drop. Further meaningful drops restart the relevant delay; blood fluctuations smaller than 0.2% of the bar do not keep renewing it. Low health or stamina keeps the panel visible without a timeout. Exactly 50% health or 20% stamina does not qualify by itself.
- **Manual HUD peek:** hold the Controls Legend button (Menu on Xbox, Options on PlayStation, or L on keyboard by default) to show the player HUD for **3 seconds**. Repeat the gesture to refresh the peek. When it ends, automatic health/stamina visibility resumes.
- **Parry/attack indicators:** Show directional parry cues displays the incoming attack direction and highlights its arrow during the parry window, independently of the game's Directional Indicator option.
- **Counterattack direction:** Show counterattack direction displays the weak-spot attack direction during counterattack openings, including after a perfect parry. The cue ends when the game clears the opening. Combat cue size adjusts all combat icons and directions together from 10% to 200% in 10% steps, defaulting to 100%.

At 0% opacity, Quiet Dawn hides the general HUD between alerts and reveals. Item and ability quickslots appear briefly after using the switch control (3 seconds by default); the double-arrow switch hint stays hidden. The special-attack panel appears only while its cooldown is running. Positive panel opacity keeps the chosen value, subject to the game's visibility rules. All 17 managed panels have 0% to 100% opacity sliders in 5-point steps. Interaction prompts, dialogue, subtitles, notifications and menus retain game behavior. Manual HUD peek reveals the other managed player panels at full opacity; the Focus hint, switch hint and special-attack panel keep their own rules. Enemy health and directional indicators keep their configured behavior.

The Sprint and Haste button prompts stay hidden while running. Turn off **Hide sprint/haste prompt** in the optional menu, or set `hideSprintPrompt = 0` in `settings.ini`, to restore them. Other action prompts retain game behavior, and manual HUD peek keeps running prompts hidden.

The Toggle abilities hint (RT with the remapped controller layout) stays hidden in Focus mode and during manual HUD peek. Ability switching still works. Raise Focus activation prompt opacity above 0% to restore the hint.

Health and blood gains of at least 1% of the bar reveal the stat panel for the existing health hold duration. Smaller regeneration stays quiet until the bar reaches full. That full-bar reveal rearms only after a deficit of at least 0.2%, preventing repeated near-full notifications. Positive panel opacity and low-resource thresholds keep their existing behavior.

The time-of-day panel is hidden by default. It appears at full opacity when time advances, then hides 4 seconds after the last time change. Time of day reveal duration adjusts from 0 to 10 seconds in 0.5-second steps; 0 disables automatic reveals. A positive Time of day opacity keeps it shown at the selected opacity. HUD peek also reveals it.

## Requirements and compatibility

- **Optional:** [Mod Setting Menu 1.0.5 or later](https://www.nexusmods.com/thebloodofdawnwalker/mods/271) provides the in-game settings interface. Quiet Dawn works with its defaults and supports manual `settings.ini` editing without it.
- UE4SS for BoD **Framecore 2b** with the bundled native HUD bridge, or a Dawnwalker-compatible UE4SS build with Blueprint script hooks enabled, exposing `ExecuteInGameThreadWithDelay`, `CancelDelayedAction`, `KismetSystemLibrary.GetFrameCount`, and `GetGameTimeInSeconds`. Development reference: commit `97b7e501c`.
- Stock HUD/API reference: Steam build **25232147**, executable CL-258504.
- Disable **HUD Tweaks and HUD Tweaks - Fixes** before enabling this mod. They are not dependencies and can compete over opacity despite having different filenames.
- Mods altering the managed HUD panels require compatibility testing.

## Install, update, and remove

### UE4SS setup

**Framecore 2b:** use its Performance profile with the bundled `dlls/main.dll`. The helper supplies Quiet Dawn's HUD events while `HookProcessInternal` and `HookProcessLocalScriptFunction` remain 0 in the INI. It does not rewrite the loader configuration. Keep the helper and Lua scripts from the same package together.

If you previously installed the **Quiet Dawn - Configurable HUD - Framecore Settings** overlay, back up your loader preferences, disable that overlay in Vortex, and deploy Framecore's preferred profile. Do not run `Enable-Blueprint-Hooks.bat` when using the native bridge with the Performance profile.

**Other UE4SS builds, including Vercadi:** use the regular Blueprint dispatcher. With the game closed, the optional `Enable-Blueprint-Hooks.bat` in `Dawnwalker/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/Mods/QuietDawnHUD/` enables `HookProcessLocalScriptFunction` in the existing INI and saves a uniquely named backup. It preserves other settings, comments and encoding; if the INI is absent, it can use the installed Framecore Performance template. Duplicate or malformed settings stop the script without edits. It never changes `HookProcessInternal`. Restart the game afterward.

The native route targets Framecore 2b's specific DLL. Another DLL hash or an already-enabled script dispatcher retains Quiet Dawn's regular Lua hook route. Native build details and the supported hash are in [native build notes](https://github.com/my-mods/Dawnwalker-Quiet-Dawn-Configurable-HUD/blob/main/native/BUILD.md).

1. Close the game. Disable HUD Tweaks and its Fixes submod in Vortex and deploy.
2. Import `Quiet-Dawn-Configurable-HUD.zip`. Choose **UE4SS (Lua mods)**, enable, and deploy.
3. Runtime files belong under `Dawnwalker/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/Mods/QuietDawnHUD/`. Restart the game; live Lua or DLL reload is not supported.

Install **one version only**. When updating an older version, back up `Scripts/QuietDawnConfig.lua` and your personal diagnostics INI before Vortex removes or replaces the old package. To import those choices, restore the legacy Lua file beside the new scripts before first launch. The new ZIP supplies `QuietDawnDefaults.lua` and does not overwrite that legacy filename. After migration, back up the generated `settings.ini` for future reinstalls. Reinstall through Vortex’s installer when the package layout changes.

To remove, close the game, disable/remove the mod in Vortex, and deploy. No save-game data is changed.

## Compass

Change Compass opacity in the optional menu, or edit `compassOpacity` in `settings.ini`: 0% hides it; 50% shows it at half opacity; 100% is fully opaque. No separate compass toggle is needed; opacity alone controls visibility. The old Show Compass variant is no longer needed; its preferences can be imported from your backed-up legacy Lua file on first use.

## Settings

[Mod Setting Menu 1.0.5 or later](https://www.nexusmods.com/thebloodofdawnwalker/mods/271) is optional. To use it, open Main Menu > Mod Settings > All Mods, select Quiet Dawn, change settings, press Apply, then load a save. Restore discards unapplied changes; Reset selects this mod's defaults. The mod works and can be fully configured without this menu.

### Defaults without the menu

On a fresh install with no saved or imported preferences, the mod is enabled and all 17 player HUD opacities start at 0% (automatic hiding and contextual reveals). Enemy health bars, enemy names, difficulty icons, and sprint/haste prompts are hidden. All four combat cue toggles are Off; cue size is 100%. Health/blood below 50% or stamina below 20% keeps the stat panels visible. Health alerts hold for 4 seconds and stamina alerts for 1.5 seconds. Holding Controls Legend reveals the HUD for 3 seconds; switching quickslots reveals them for 3 seconds; time changes reveal the time panel for 4 seconds. Logging is Off. Existing saved or supported imported preferences take precedence over these defaults.

### Manual configuration without the menu

1. Install Quiet Dawn through Vortex with its required UE4SS loader, then launch the game once. Quiet Dawn creates its own `settings.ini`; you can load a save and play immediately with the defaults.
2. Close the game and back up that generated file. Open `<game folder>/Dawnwalker/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/Mods/QuietDawnHUD/settings.ini` in a text editor.
3. Edit the existing entries under `[Settings]`, keeping every other entry and the section header. Use `1` for On and `0` for Off, percentages such as `50` (not `0.5`), and seconds such as `1.5`. Keep the exact key names and use a decimal point. Do not add duplicate keys or replace the file with the example below.
4. Save the file, restart the game, and load a save. The next save load reads your values; settings are not polled during play.

Example edits to the matching existing lines (this is not a complete settings file):

```ini
compassOpacity = 50
opacity_Crosshair = 100
hideSprintPrompt = 0
hideEnemyNames = 0
hideEnemyDifficultyIcons = 0
showCounterattackDirection = 1
showDirectionalParry = 1
```

This shows the compass at half opacity and the crosshair at full opacity when the game permits, restores running prompts and enemy labels/icons, and enables counterattack and parry directions. Other preferences stay as saved. Set any option back to its listed default to restore that behavior.

Edit `settings.ini`, not `mod_settings.ini` (the optional menu definition), `Scripts/QuietDawnDefaults.lua` (first-use defaults), or the old import-only files. The menu and manual editing use the same settings file, so adding or removing the menu does not require converting your preferences. Keep a backup before a Vortex reinstall.

See [SETTINGS.md](SETTINGS.md) for every key, default, supported value, first-use import, and recovery details.

## Behavior and performance

Framecore 2b uses a native filter for Quiet Dawn's HUD events. It copies event values into a bounded queue and delivers them through the existing game-thread scheduler. Player alerts take priority over enemy-widget bursts; settings retain their save-load behavior. The helper adds no polling thread or continuous readiness timer.

Player creation and possession can activate the HUD when a loading-screen notification is missed. Readiness checks share one finite window of less than ten seconds; they stop after success or exhaustion and can resume on a later player event. An old world's player cannot activate a new session. Ordinary travel retains the settings snapshot.

Enable **Logging** (the final optional menu entry), or set `debugLogging = 1` in `settings.ini`, for activation and HUD diagnostics in `Dawnwalker/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/UE4SS.log`. Apply and load a save; restart the game to diagnose an activation failure that prevents the new snapshot from loading. Activation summaries include the event source, readiness attempts, failure reason and aggregate CPU time. Logging is off by default. Hook-registration failures include the exact function path and exception once per hook per session.

Lifecycle and preset callbacks initialize/reapply the named panels. Health, blood, and stamina change handlers, plus the stat widgets' event-driven update functions, request a coalesced read of the current player's active resource percentages. The update-function hooks also cover direct event-graph dispatch. Blood-bar capacity changes are covered by the same widget update path. There is no recurring stat sampler. The stamina handler is bound by the shared HUD's vampire stats widget during initialization in both forms. Rapid loss followed by recovery still records the largest loss in that event burst, even if a smaller blood fluctuation follows.

A single pending hide deadline uses cached resource values and game time; it never rereads health or stamina. Further meaningful damage or healing extends the health deadline; reaching full after a meaningful deficit also reveals health once. Pausing preserves the remaining hold time: an outstanding deadline may reschedule for the remaining game-time delay. The same deadline ends manual HUD peeks, quickslot reveals and time-change reveals independently, including while health is low. It then restores normal hiding for the other panels while leaving low health visible. Once the relevant holds expire, no deadline timer continues. Panel updates run on separate frames.

Ownership checks use Unreal object addresses. Different Lua wrappers for the same object retain its cached state; old HUD/world events are ignored. Missing readings or unavailable resource hooks leave stat panels under normal game visibility when possible. Failed hook setup uses finite retries and can recover on a subsequent HUD/player lifecycle event. There is no polling fallback. Known health alerts use full opacity even if a stat panel was transparent during initialization. Form selection and the game's visibility presets remain in effect. Unknown forms or unavailable blood data leave the stat panels under game control.

Enemy health hiding uses the named health widgets verified in Steam build 25232147. Construction and target/owner changes schedule bounded work on the shared HUD worker, one named child per frame. It does not scan enemies, poll their stats, or change their actual health. A missing child exhausts its own readiness attempts; the remaining children are still processed. A later target or owner event retries missing children.

Combat cue changes use the existing marker construction, icon-render and lock events. Each update touches a fixed set of named child widgets; no widget-tree search or recurring timer is added. Parry and counterattack directions suppress center icons, and the lock toggle shows a padlock only on a hard-locked target between cues. The game retains control of distance fading and overall widget visibility. Readiness retries and the 64-entry marker cache/queue remain bounded. Logging reports the observed state, selected cue, size and readiness failures.

There are no global HUD searches, widget-tree walks, class-default changes, or recurring configuration reads. The panel worker terminates after each job. Resource events that leave visibility unchanged do not revisit panels. Resource visibility changes revisit only the two stat panels; unrelated HUD fields are checked on lifecycle/preset events and when a manual peek begins or ends. Missing fields are not retried on each resource change. Setting both stat panels to a positive opacity disables resource hooks and reads. Manual HUD peek remains available and temporarily shows the managed panels at 100%, then restores their selected opacity or automatic behavior.

# Settings

[Mod Setting Menu 1.0.5 or later](https://www.nexusmods.com/thebloodofdawnwalker/mods/271) is optional. To use it, open Main Menu > Mod Settings > All Mods, select Quiet Dawn, change settings, press Apply, then load a save. Restore discards unapplied changes; Reset selects this mod's defaults. The mod works and can be fully configured without this menu.

## Default behavior

On a fresh install with no saved or imported preferences, the mod is enabled and all 17 player HUD opacities start at 0% (automatic hiding and contextual reveals). Enemy health bars, enemy names, difficulty icons, and sprint/haste prompts are hidden. All four combat cue toggles are Off; cue size is 100%. Health/blood below 50% or stamina below 20% keeps the stat panels visible. Health alerts hold for 4 seconds and stamina alerts for 1.5 seconds. Holding Controls Legend reveals the HUD for 3 seconds; switching quickslots reveals them for 3 seconds; time changes reveal the time panel for 4 seconds. Logging is Off. Existing saved or supported imported preferences take precedence over these defaults.

## Manual configuration

1. Install Quiet Dawn through Vortex with its required UE4SS loader, then launch the game once. Quiet Dawn creates its own `settings.ini`; you can load a save and play immediately with the defaults.
2. Close the game and back up that generated file. Open `<game folder>/Dawnwalker/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/Mods/QuietDawnHUD/settings.ini` in a text editor.
3. Edit the existing entries under `[Settings]`, keeping every other entry and the section header. Use `1` for On and `0` for Off, percentages such as `50` (not `0.5`), and seconds such as `1.5`. Keep the exact key names and use a decimal point. Do not add duplicate keys or replace the file with the example below.
4. Save the file, restart the game, and load a save. The next save load reads your values; settings are not polled during play.

Example edits to the matching existing lines (this is not a complete settings file):

```ini
compassOpacity = 50
opacity_Crosshair = 100
hideSprintPrompt = 0
hideEnemyNames = 0
hideEnemyDifficultyIcons = 0
showCounterattackDirection = 1
showDirectionalParry = 1
```

This shows the compass at half opacity and the crosshair at full opacity when the game permits, restores running prompts and enemy labels/icons, and enables counterattack and parry directions. Other preferences stay as saved. Set any option back to its listed default to restore that behavior.

Edit `settings.ini`, not `mod_settings.ini` (the optional menu definition), `Scripts/QuietDawnDefaults.lua` (first-use defaults), or the old import-only files. The menu and manual editing use the same settings file, so adding or removing the menu does not require converting your preferences. Keep a backup before a Vortex reinstall.

The stable menu ID is `oOCamilleOo_QuietDawnHUD`. The mod generates `settings.ini` beside `mod_settings.ini` in its UE4SS mod folder. This generated file is the authoritative settings store and is not shipped in the ZIP. Existing supported preferences are imported on first use. After the new settings are saved and verified, the successfully imported legacy files are deleted if their contents are unchanged. Migration or save failures retain the originals. Cleanup failures are logged and do not prevent using the new settings. Files left by an earlier migration are not deleted automatically. Back up `settings.ini` before removing/reinstalling the mod or moving its folder. Restore that backup into the same runtime folder before launching. Do not restore an old INI over it.

Missing existing settings, duplicate or invalid settings stop configuration loading and are reported in `Dawnwalker/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/UE4SS.log`. Preserve the file before correcting it. If a menu save fails, preserve its temporary/backup files and follow the menu’s recovery instructions. Startup prepares the settings file once, including any supported upgrade. Gameplay reads a fresh settings snapshot when a save loads. Waiting at the main menu performs no recurring settings work; travel and possession events use the current snapshot. Settings are never polled. `debugLogging` controls additional diagnostic logging; it defaults to Off.

Turn off **Hide enemy names** to restore enemy name labels (boss names), or **Hide enemy difficulty icons** to restore difficulty indicators for ordinary enemies and bosses. The choices are independent. Apply, then load a save. The player HUD peek keeps both choices in effect. At startup, older settings files receive any missing enemy-label options, set to On. Existing preferences and comments are preserved.

The four Combat cues toggles work independently of the game's Directional Indicator option. Counterattack directions show the attack opening after a perfect parry; unblockable warnings show the skull; directional parry cues show the incoming direction and highlight its arrow during the parry window; the lock option shows a padlock on a hard-locked target between cues. The dot stays hidden and directions hide all center lock icons. All four toggles default to Off. Combat cue size scales the whole cue group from 10% to 200% in 10% steps, defaulting to 100%. Apply, then load a save. Existing counterattack choices are retained when adding the new controls. Logging reports the observed icon, selected arrow or warning, lock state, size and readiness failures in `Dawnwalker/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/UE4SS.log`.

Console commands are not used to change settings.

Conditional rows and groups show relevant controls as you edit. Hidden options keep their saved values; hiding an option does not reset it. The optional interface uses toggles, labeled choices and sliders. For manual editing, use the exact numeric keys and values below.

When upgrading an older Quiet Dawn package, back up `Scripts/QuietDawnConfig.lua` before Vortex replaces/removes that package. Restore the backed-up file beside the new scripts before first launch to import its panel/compass choices. If it is absent, the mod uses QuietDawnDefaults.lua. Successfully imported legacy Lua and diagnostics files are removed after the new settings are saved and verified.

**HUD opacity:** all 17 player panels have 0% to 100% sliders in 5-point steps. At 0%, Quiet Dawn manages visibility through resource alerts, quickslot switching, special-attack cooldowns, time changes and manual peek. Positive opacity keeps the selected value while the game controls contextual visibility. HUD peek reveals other managed panels at 100%; the Focus hint, switch hint and special-attack panel retain their own rules.

**Show HUD** uses the game's **Toggle Controls Legend** action. Hold **Menu (Xbox)**, **Options (PlayStation)**, or **L (keyboard)** by default. To change the controller button, edit **Toggle Controls Legend** in Controller Tweaks and Remap. For keyboard, change the game's Controls Legend binding. Quiet Dawn follows the remapped action. Show HUD duration controls the time the HUD remains visible after activation.

**Logging** is the final optional menu setting and the only diagnostic control; manually set `debugLogging` to `0` (Off) or `1` (On). Leave it Off for normal play; On writes troubleshooting details to `Dawnwalker/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/UE4SS.log`.

**Timers:** all five HUD durations range from 0 to 10 seconds in 0.5-second steps. Zero disables that timed reveal. Health and stamina thresholds and positive panel opacity still apply independently. Defaults remain 4 seconds for health/blood, 1.5 seconds for stamina, 3 seconds for HUD peek, 3 seconds for quickslot switching and 4 seconds for time of day. Older durations above 10 seconds are capped at 10; other fractional durations round to the nearest half-second. If an existing settings file needs this adjustment, the original is kept as `settings.ini.before-short-timers`, preserving all other preferences and comments.

**Visibility thresholds:** keep the health/stamina display visible while human health or vampire blood is below 50%, or stamina is below 20%, by default. Exactly the selected percentage does not trigger the threshold. Damage and stamina use can also reveal it for their hold durations, even above the thresholds. A 0% threshold disables that low-resource trigger. These rules apply when the corresponding panel opacity is 0%. Positive opacity keeps that panel shown without resource-driven hiding.

Older On/Off panel settings are imported into the new opacity controls: Off becomes 0% and On becomes 100%. The upgrade adds the new keys while preserving existing settings, unknown keys and comments; it retains the original file under a `settings.ini.before-*` name for the upgrade being applied (currently `settings.ini.before-combat-cues`). Earlier recovery backups are retained. Compass opacity remains unchanged. Keep recovery files if an upgrade error is reported.

Switching items/abilities briefly reveals panels set to 0%; positive opacity stays at its selected value. The switch hint remains at its own opacity, including during manual HUD peek. Set the special-attack panel to 0% to show it only while recharging; positive values show it normally at the chosen opacity. Both still respect the game's visibility restrictions. The reveal duration uses game time and pauses with the game.

Small blood fluctuations below 0.2% of bar capacity do not renew the health hold. Low-resource thresholds and human damage/stamina alerts remain unchanged. Existing opacity settings gain the new duration without changing selected values; keep the `settings.ini.before-hud-events` recovery copy.

**Time of day:** 0% opacity hides the complete time panel between time changes and HUD peeks. Time changes reveal it at 100% and restart the reveal duration, which defaults to 4 seconds. Pausing preserves the remaining duration. Set the duration to 0 seconds to disable automatic time-change reveals; HUD peek still works. Positive opacity keeps the panel shown and does not use the timer. Existing settings gain these two options without resetting other preferences.

**Hide sprint/haste prompt** suppresses only the running prompts, including during manual HUD peek. Other action prompts retain game behavior. Apply, then load a save. Existing settings receive the new option set to On, with their preferences and comments preserved.

**Focus activation prompt opacity:** 0% keeps the Toggle abilities button and label hidden in Focus mode and during HUD peek. Positive values use the selected opacity when the game shows the prompt. Ability switching still works. Apply, then load a save.

**Healing and regeneration:** Health and blood gains of at least 1% of the bar reveal the stat panel for the existing health hold duration. Smaller regeneration stays quiet until the bar reaches full. That full-bar reveal rearms only after a deficit of at least 0.2%, preventing repeated near-full notifications. Positive panel opacity and low-resource thresholds keep their existing behavior. The health / blood hold duration also controls these healing reveals; 0 disables them. Small stamina recovery does not trigger a reveal.

A panel opacity of 0 retains automatic behavior; positive opacity keeps that panel at the chosen opacity subject to game visibility rules. Timers accept 0 to 10 seconds in 0.5-second steps; 0 disables that timed reveal without disabling independent low-resource triggers. Percentages are stored on a 0 to 100 scale. Combat cue size accepts 10 to 200 in 10-point steps.

If a value is malformed, duplicated, missing, or outside the supported range, the settings loader reports it in `Dawnwalker/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/UE4SS.log`. Correct the existing line or restore your backup, then restart and load a save.
